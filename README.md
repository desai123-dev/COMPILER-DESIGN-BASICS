Project Title: compiler-design -basics
Internship Program: CODTECH â€“ Task 4

Project Description:
This project focuses on the fundamentals of compiler design by implementing a simple arithmetic expression evaluator in C++. The objective is to simulate the core functionality of a basic compiler that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions, adhering to the typical stages of lexical analysis and syntax parsing.

Core Components:
The solution is divided into two major components:

Lexer (Lexical Analyzer):
This module reads the raw input string character by character and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of the language and include numbers, operators (+, -, *, /), and parentheses ((, )). The lexer ensures that invalid characters are flagged, thereby enforcing basic input validity.
Parser and Evaluator:
The parser reads tokens from the lexer and organizes them according to defined grammar rules, mimicking a recursive descent parser. It uses functions for:
factor(): Parses numbers or parenthetical expressions.
term(): Handles multiplication and division.
expr(): Handles addition and subtraction.

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates the basics of compiler construction, specifically lexical analysis and recursive descent parsing. While it does not generate machine code or intermediate code, it captures the foundational concepts of parsing and evaluation, which are essential in any compiler. The implementation not only satisfies the CODTECH internship requirement but also provides a solid stepping stone for exploring more advanced topics in compiler design, such as abstract syntax trees, semantic analysis, and code generation.
